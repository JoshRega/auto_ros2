## Contributing

It can be difficult to know where to start. Luckily, we have a list of [projects you can work on](https://github.com/orgs/Sooner-Rover-Team/projects/4/views/1)! Some of these have hidden progression or difficulties, so please discuss with Autonomous leadership before you start working on something new.

For info about conventions (how we write/upload code, etc.), please see [our documentation on contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
